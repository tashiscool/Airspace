# Advanced Polymorphic Airspace Management System

## Project Motivation
Recent tragic events, including the fatal January 29 collision near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, have underscored the critical importance of modernizing airspace management systems. The FAA is actively pursuing comprehensive upgrades, integrating advanced technology and artificial intelligence to prevent similar incidents. This project aligns directly with these initiatives, leveraging extensive professional experience to deliver an innovative solution for dynamic, safe, and efficient airspace management.

Key motivations include:
- **Enhanced Safety**: Utilizing predictive analytics and real-time conflict detection to prevent accidents.
- **Dynamic Adaptability**: Addressing real-time environmental changes, including weather conditions and airspace constraints.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Ensuring flexibility and extensibility with cloud-based, microservice-oriented infrastructure.
- **Precision and Efficiency**: Incorporating advanced geospatial calculations and optimized routing algorithms.

## Example Usage

### Route Planning Example
```java
DynamicRoutePlanner planner = new DynamicRoutePlanner.Builder()
    .addConstraint(new AltitudeConstraint(30000, 40000))
    .addConstraint(new RestrictedAirspaceConstraint(restrictedAreaPolygon))
    .sensorConfig(new ReplanningSensorConfig.Builder().samplingInterval(15).build())
    .build();

DynamicRoute route = planner.planRoute(startPoint, endPoint, departureTime);
```

### Conflict Detection Example
```java
StandardConflictDetection conflictDetection = new StandardConflictDetection();
List<SeparationConflict> conflicts = conflictDetection.detectConflicts(flightTrajectory.getMainPath());
```
